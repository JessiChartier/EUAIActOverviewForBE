## Self-Assessment Checklist

### Mandatory Transparency Requirements Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate your system architecture against EU AI Act transparency requirements:

#### High-Risk Systems

| Requirement Category | Required Elements | Implementation Status |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Explainability** | • Technical explanations available<br>• Non-technical explanations available<br>• Feature importance metrics<br>• Explanation retrieval interfaces | □ Compliant<br>□ Partially compliant<br>□ Non-compliant |
| **Audit Trail** | • Complete input/output logging<br>• Explainability event logging<br>• Human oversight logging<br>• Compliant retention periods | □ Compliant<br>□ Partially compliant<br>□ Non-compliant |
| **Human Oversight** | • Review interfaces<br>• Intervention mechanisms<br>• Decision override capability<br>• Notification systems | □ Compliant<br>□ Partially compliant<br>□ Non-compliant |
| **Documentation** | • Model cards accessible via API<br>• Training data documentation<br>• Performance metrics accessibility<br>• Technical specifications | □ Compliant<br>□ Partially compliant<br>□ Non-compliant |

#### Limited-Risk Systems

| Requirement Category | Required Elements | Implementation Status |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Explainability** | • Basic explanation of AI operation<br>• Notification of AI interaction | □ Compliant<br>□ Partially compliant<br>□ Non-compliant |
| **Audit Trail** | • Basic logging of system usage<br>• Standard retention periods | □ Compliant<br>□ Partially compliant<br>□ Non-compliant |
| **Documentation** | • System capabilities documentation<br>• Limitations documentation | □ Compliant<br>□ Partially compliant<br>□ Non-compliant |

### Technical Implementation Gap Analysis

For each non-compliant area, use this framework to plan implementation:

```python
# EXAMPLE: Gap Analysis Tool (pseudocode)
# This is ONE possible approach to identifying gaps

def perform_gap_analysis(system_architecture):
    """
    Example function to analyze transparency gaps
    Your actual implementation will differ
    """
    gaps = []
    
    # Example checks - your specific checks will depend on your architecture
    if not has_explanation_endpoints(system_architecture):
        gaps.append({
            "requirement": "Explainability Interfaces",
            "current_state": "Missing explanation endpoints",
            "compliance_impact": "High - Required for transparency",
            "implementation_complexity": "Medium",
            "suggested_approach": "Implement REST endpoints for explanation retrieval"
        })
    
    if not has_sufficient_audit_logging(system_architecture):
        gaps.append({
            "requirement": "Audit Trail",
            "current_state": "Insufficient event logging",
            "compliance_impact": "High - Required for all systems",
            "implementation_complexity": "Medium-High",
            "suggested_approach": "Extend current logging with AI Act required fields"
        })
    
    # Return identified gaps
    return gaps
```

## Knowledge Check

Test your understanding of EU AI Act transparency requirements:

1. **Which components are required in a high-risk AI system architecture?**  
   a) Model versioning and A/B testing framework  
   b) Explainability services, audit logging, and human oversight  
   c) Microservice architecture with Kubernetes orchestration  
   d) Public API endpoints for all model functionality  

2. **What must be stored in audit trails for high-risk systems?**  
   a) Complete source code for all models  
   b) System uptime and performance metrics  
   c) Input data, output decisions, and explanation metadata  
   d) Team member information who developed the model  

3. **Which statement about explainability is correct?**  
   a) Only black-box models require explanations  
   b) You must use SHAP values for all explanations  
   c) Both technical and non-technical explanations are required for high-risk systems  
   d) Feature importance is only required for computer vision models  

4. **What is a required architectural element for human oversight?**  
   a) Verbal approval process documented manually  
   b) Technical mechanisms for reviewing and overriding AI decisions  
   c) Cross-functional team structure for model deployment  
   d) Weekly human review of all decisions  

5. **Which statement about transparency implementation is true?**  
   a) The EU AI Act requires REST APIs for all transparency interfaces  
   b) The regulation specifies exact storage duration requirements for all data types  
   c) The regulation requires what must be achieved, but implementation details are flexible  
   d) All high-risk systems must use blockchain for immutable audit trails  

## Architecture Review Exercise

### Example System Assessment

Review this simplified architecture diagram and identify missing transparency components:

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │      │                 │      │                 │
│  Client App     │──────│  API Gateway    │──────│  Model Server   │
│                 │      │                 │      │                 │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
                                                         │
                                                         │
                                                  ┌──────▼──────┐
                                                  │             │
                                                  │  Database   │
                                                  │             │
                                                  └─────────────┘
```

    """
    Example showing potential architectural extensions
    Your implementation approach will vary based on your stack
    """
    
    def identify_missing_components(self, architecture):
        missing = []
        
        # Required components for transparency - implementation details flexible
        if not architecture.has_component("explanation_service"):

### Self-Assessment Discussion

After completing the exercise, consider:

1. How would you integrate transparency requirements with your current architecture?
2. What are the main technical challenges you anticipate?
3. Which existing components could be extended to support transparency?
4. How would you balance performance with compliance requirements?

## References and Resources

### EU AI Act Technical References
- Official EU AI Act technical specifications
- Risk classification reference guide
- Required documentation templates
- Minimum retention period guidelines

### Implementation Resources
- Open-source explainability libraries
- Audit logging frameworks
- Architecture patterns for compliance
- Performance optimization techniques

### Verification Tools
- Compliance testing frameworks

Remember: The EU AI Act specifies **what** transparency capabilities your architecture must support, but the **how** of implementation is flexible and should align with your organization's technical stack and practices.
