## 1.1 Regulatory Context
### EU AI Act Mandatory Requirements

The EU AI Act establishes specific transparency requirements based on an AI system's risk classification:

| Risk Classification | Mandatory Transparency Requirements |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| High-Risk Systems | • Complete system documentation<br>• Technical transparency for users<br>• Explainable decisions<br>• Audit trail capabilities<br>• Human oversight mechanisms |
| Limited-Risk Systems | • Disclosure of AI system use<br>• Basic transparency of capabilities<br>• Documentation of limitations |
| Minimal-Risk Systems | • Basic documentation |

These requirements are **mandatory** and must be implemented regardless of your technical architecture.

### Implementation Flexibility

As a backend engineer, you have flexibility in **how** you implement these requirements. The EU AI Act doesn't mandate:
- Specific technologies or programming languages
- Particular architectural patterns
- Exact implementation methods

## 1.2 Core Architectural Components

### Required Architectural Capabilities

To comply with the EU AI Act, your architecture must support these capabilities:

1. **Explainability interfaces** - Technical means to expose model decisions
2. **Audit logging** - Systematic recording of system activities
3. **Human oversight** - Mechanisms for human review and intervention
4. **Documentation access** - Interfaces to access required documentation

### Implementation Flexibility

While these capabilities are required, you have flexibility in implementation:

```python
# EXAMPLE: This is ONE possible interface design for explainability
# Your implementation may differ based on your tech stack

class ModelTransparencyInterface:
    def get_explanation(self, prediction_id: str, format_type: str = "technical") -> Dict:
        """
        Retrieve explanation for a specific prediction.
        Required by EU AI Act, but implementation details are flexible.
        
        Args:
            prediction_id: Unique identifier for the prediction
            format_type: Either "technical" (for developers/auditors) or 
                        "non_technical" (for end users)
        """
        pass
        
    def get_model_card(self, model_id: str) -> Dict:
        """
        Retrieve standardized model documentation.
        Required for high-risk systems.
        """
        pass
        
    def get_dataset_summary(self, model_id: str) -> Dict:
        """
        Retrieve information about training data.
        Required for high-risk systems.
        """
        pass
```

Consider your existing architecture and how these capabilities can be integrated with minimal disruption.

### Reference Architecture Example

```python
# EXAMPLE: One possible audit logging implementation
# Your approach may differ significantly based on your existing systems

class AuditLogger:
    def log_prediction(self, 
                       prediction_id: str, 
                       model_id: str,
                       input_data: Dict,
                       output_data: Dict,
                       user_id: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
        """
        Log prediction details for compliance with EU AI Act.
        Implementation details are flexible, but logging is required.
        
        For high-risk systems, you must preserve:
        - Input data
        - Output data
        - Timestamp
        - Model identifier
        - User context (if available)
        """
        timestamp = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        
        # This implementation is ONE example - yours will differ
        audit_record = {
            "event_type": "prediction",
            "prediction_id": prediction_id,
            "model_id": model_id,
            "timestamp": timestamp,
            "user_id": user_id,
            # How you store/hash/encrypt these is flexible
            "input_hash": self._hash_data(input_data),
            "output_hash": self._hash_data(output_data)
        }
        
        # Storage method is flexible (database, log files, etc.)
        self._store_audit_record(audit_record)
        
        # For high-risk systems, store complete input/output
        if self._is_high_risk(model_id):
            self._store_prediction_details(prediction_id, input_data, output_data)
```

## 1.3 Data Flow Architecture Requirements

### Required Data Flows

The EU AI Act requires specific data to flow through your system:

1. **Input capture** - All inputs must be recorded for high-risk systems
2. **Output logging** - Decisions must be captured
3. **Explanation generation** - Explanations must be created and stored
4. **Audit events** - System activities must be logged

### Implementation Flexibility

The implementation specifics are flexible:

```python
# EXAMPLE: Database schema for transparency storage
# This is ONE possible approach - your implementation may differ

"""
Example schema (pseudocode) showing required data elements:

CREATE TABLE predictions (
    prediction_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    model_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    model_version VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    input_reference VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- How you reference inputs is flexible
    output_reference VARCHAR NOT NULL, -- How you reference outputs is flexible
    user_id VARCHAR,
    risk_level VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    explanation_id VARCHAR,
    FOREIGN KEY (explanation_id) REFERENCES explanations(explanation_id)
);

CREATE TABLE explanations (
    explanation_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    prediction_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    explanation_method VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    explanation_data TEXT NOT NULL,    -- Format is flexible
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (prediction_id) REFERENCES predictions(prediction_id)
);
"""
```

### Performance Optimization Example

```python
# EXAMPLE: Asynchronous explanation generation
# This pattern is optional - synchronous approaches are also valid

async def handle_prediction_request(inputs, model_id, user_id=None):
    """Example showing one approach to handling predictions with transparency"""
    # 1. Generate prediction (implementation flexible)
    prediction = model_service.predict(model_id, inputs)
    prediction_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    # 2. Log prediction (required for high-risk systems)
    audit_logger.log_prediction(
        prediction_id=prediction_id,
        model_id=model_id,
        input_data=inputs,
        output_data=prediction,
        user_id=user_id
    )
    
    # 3. Generate explanation asynchronously (implementation flexible)
    if requires_explanation(model_id):
        # This async approach is optional - sync is also valid
        asyncio.create_task(
            explanation_service.generate_and_store_explanation(
                prediction_id, model_id, inputs, prediction
            )
        )
    
    # 4. Return response with prediction ID for traceability
    return {
        "prediction": prediction,
        "prediction_id": prediction_id,
        # Include transparency information as required by EU AI Act
        "model_info": model_service.get_model_info(model_id),
        "explanation_available": requires_explanation(model_id)
    }
```

## Implementation Guidance

Rather than adopting example code directly, backend engineers should:

1. **Analyze the gap** between current systems and regulatory requirements
2. **Design integration points** with existing architecture
3. **Leverage existing components** where possible (logging, monitoring)
4. **Consider data volume and performance** impacts
5. **Plan for verification** to ensure compliance

Remember that the EU AI Act specifies *what* must be achieved, not *how* it must be implemented technically. Your implementation should align with your organization's technology stack, development practices, and existing systems.
