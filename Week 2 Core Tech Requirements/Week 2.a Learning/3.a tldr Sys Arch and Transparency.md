# TL;DR: System Architecture and Transparency

## Key Requirements
- EU AI Act requires specific architectural components to enable model transparency
- High-risk AI systems need more extensive transparency mechanisms than limited-risk systems
- Your architecture must support both technical and non-technical explanations of AI decisions

## Core Components You Need to Implement
1. **Explainability interfaces** - APIs that expose model behavior and decision factors
2. **Audit trails** - Comprehensive logging of model inputs, outputs, and explanations
3. **Human oversight mechanisms** - Technical controls allowing human intervention
4. **Metadata storage** - Infrastructure to maintain model cards and training dataset information

## Quick Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Decision explanations available via API endpoints
- [ ] Feature importance metrics calculated and stored
- [ ] Model cards accessible through system interfaces
- [ ] Audit logs capturing all required transparency data
- [ ] Human oversight controls implemented (for high-risk systems)

## Backend Engineering Impact
You'll need to modify your architecture to expose model internals that were previously encapsulated. Expect impacts on:
- API design
- Storage requirements
- Performance overhead
- Request/response workflows
