# EU AI Act Overview For Backend Engineers
**NOTE: this course is for a portfolio piece only; it is incomplete and should not be seen as a full training of the EU AI Act.**

Duration: 3 weeks (3 hours per week)
Focus: Building awareness of EU AI Act requirements relevant to backend engineering

In this course, backend engineers gain the necessary awareness of EU AI Act requirements without the depth needed for implementation or decision making. It provides enough knowledge for Backend Engineers to:
- Identify potential compliance issues
- Communicate effectively with team leads on compliance matters
- Understand the "why" behind new technical requirements
- Recognize when to escalate compliance concerns

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, learners will be able to:
- Identify the logging system requirements outlined in the EU AI Act
- Describe system architecture elements that enable model transparency
- List the key metrics required for monitoring AI performance and bias
- Outline the technical documentation requirements mandated by the EU AI Act
- Recognize technical safeguards needed for high-risk AI systems
- Explain the verification approaches for testing compliance requirements
