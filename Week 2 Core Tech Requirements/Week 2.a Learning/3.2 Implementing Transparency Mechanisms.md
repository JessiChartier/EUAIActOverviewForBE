## 2.1 Model Explainability Requirements

### EU AI Act Requirements

The EU AI Act mandates these specific explainability requirements:

| Risk Classification | Required Explainability Features |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| High-Risk Systems | • Decision factors must be explainable<br>• Technical and non-technical explanations required<br>• Explanations must be accessible via documented interfaces<br>• Feature importance or equivalent must be available |
| Limited-Risk Systems | • Basic explanation of decision factors<br>• Users must be informed they're interacting with AI |
| Minimal-Risk Systems | • Documentation of general system capabilities |

### Implementation Flexibility

While the requirements above are mandatory, the technical implementation is flexible:

1. **Choice of Explainability Methods**: You're free to select explainability techniques appropriate for your models (SHAP, LIME, custom approaches, etc.)
2. **Architectural Approach**: You can implement explanations as:
   - Synchronous or asynchronous processes
   - Part of your prediction pipeline or separate services
   - Pre-computed or generated on-demand

### Implementation Considerations

When designing your explainability system, consider:

```python
# EXAMPLE: This is one possible approach to exposing explanations
# Your implementation may differ significantly based on your architecture

# Consider these key interfaces that your system must support
def get_explanation(prediction_id, format_type="technical"):
    """Retrieve explanation for a prediction"""
    # Implementation details are flexible
    pass

def generate_explanation(model_id, inputs, outputs):
    """Generate explanation for model outputs"""
    # Implementation details are flexible
    pass
```

The EU AI Act mandates the *what* (explanations must be available) but not the *how* (specific technologies or architectures).

## 2.2 Human Oversight Requirements

### EU AI Act Requirements

The regulation explicitly requires:

| Risk Classification | Mandatory Oversight Features |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| High-Risk Systems | • Human review capabilities<br>• Intervention mechanisms<br>• Ability to override AI decisions<br>• Monitoring for anomalies or unexpected behavior |
| Limited-Risk Systems | • Clear documentation of oversight options<br>• Optional intervention mechanisms |
| Minimal-Risk Systems | • Basic documentation |

### Implementation Flexibility

Implementation details that are flexible:

1. **Workflow Design**: You can implement oversight as:
   - Real-time (synchronous) approval processes
   - Asynchronous review queues
   - Sampling-based review systems
   - Exception-based review triggered by confidence thresholds

2. **Technical Architecture**: Multiple valid approaches include:
   - Dedicated review services
   - Features built into existing dashboards
   - Integration with ticket management systems
   - Custom review interfaces

### Implementation Considerations

```python
# EXAMPLE: One approach to human oversight interfaces
# Your implementation will vary based on your existing systems

# Core capabilities your system must support
def queue_for_human_review(prediction_id, priority=None):
    """Queue a prediction for human review"""
    # Implementation details are flexible
    pass

def record_human_decision(prediction_id, reviewer_id, decision, notes=None):
    """Record a human reviewer's decision"""
    # Implementation details are flexible
    pass
```

Focus on meeting the regulatory requirements while designing interfaces that integrate with your existing systems.

## 2.3 Audit Trail Requirements

### EU AI Act Requirements

The regulation explicitly requires:

| Risk Classification | Mandatory Audit Features |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| High-Risk Systems | • Complete audit trails<br>• Record of all decisions<br>• Documentation of inputs and outputs<br>• Evidence of compliance measures<br>• Minimum retention periods (varies by application domain) |
| Limited-Risk Systems | • Basic audit records<br>• Documentation of system usage |
| Minimal-Risk Systems | • Minimal requirements |

The regulation specifies these audit trail elements must be captured:

1. Model deployment metadata
2. Prediction inputs and outputs (for high-risk systems)
3. Explanation generation events
4. Human review decisions
5. System access records

### Implementation Flexibility

Implementation aspects that are flexible:

1. **Storage Technology**: You can use:
   - Relational databases
   - NoSQL solutions
   - Blockchain/immutable ledgers
   - Hybrid storage approaches

2. **Data Architecture**:
   - Centralized vs. federated audit storage
   - Hot/warm/cold tiered storage
   - Encryption approaches
   - Access control implementation

### Implementation Considerations

```python
# EXAMPLE: Key audit events that must be captured
# Your implementation technology and structure will vary

# These are the types of events that must be audited
REQUIRED_AUDIT_EVENTS = [
    "MODEL_DEPLOYMENT",
    "PREDICTION",
    "EXPLANATION_GENERATION",
    "HUMAN_REVIEW_DECISION",
    "DATA_ACCESS"
]

# For each event type, ensure you capture required data
# How you implement this is flexible
```

When implementing audit trails:
1. Ensure completeness of required data
2. Implement appropriate retention periods
3. Design for data volume/performance
4. Consider secure access and privacy

## Implementation Guidance for Backend Engineers

Rather than copy-pasting code snippets, focus on:

1. **Mapping requirements to your architecture**: Understand what you need to capture and expose
2. **Working with existing systems**: Integrate compliance features with your current infrastructure
3. **Designing for scale**: Your implementation must handle production workloads
4. **Security and privacy**: Implement appropriate safeguards for audit data
5. **Testing compliance**: Validate that your implementation meets regulatory requirements

Remember: The examples provided are conceptual guidance rather than production-ready implementations. Your actual code will need to integrate with your specific technology stack, security requirements, and existing architecture.
